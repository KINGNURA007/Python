What is Casting?
      If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Example"""
x = str('Casting Notes')  # x will be 'Casting Notes'
y = int(3)                # y will be 3
z = float(3)              # z will be 3.0
print (x)
print (y)
print (z)

"""Get the Type
        You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Example"""
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
