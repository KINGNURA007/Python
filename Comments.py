"""
What is Python Comments?
        Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
Comments Types:
        Singleline Comments
        Multiline Comments
Singleline Comments
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
Example
Comments in Python:
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
Example
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment.

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
Example
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

Multiline Comments
        Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
Example"""
"""This is a comment written in more than just one line"""
print("Hello, World!")
